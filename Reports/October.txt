October progress report:
    1. Functional single-threaded particle simulation code completed
        (nuclear data entered only for air, need more data for final simulation)
    2. Active work on implementing multithreading and optimization
    3. Current maximum source activity for real-time simulation
        is 200,000 decays/second (3x3x3 world with one source and 2 detectors)
    4. Hardware structure developed
    5. Ordered or obtained necessary components for breadboard prototype
        (I2C multiplexers, raspberry pi 5, pin headers,
        several ATtiny85 microcontrollers, passive buzzers)
    6. Coded, assembled (breadboard) and successfully tested first cube prototype
