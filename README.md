# Nuclear Lego - a Fun and Safe Nuclear Physics Tool

This is intended to be a modular system (base + cubes) which would make it  
easy to perform simple nuclear physics experiments without any radiation  
involved. The project is currently developed as a qualitative tool for  
demonstrations. However there is a large potential for customization, as this  
device is basically a particle transport solver with a physical real-time  
interface (cubes).  

Cubes (4 cm side) can be placed on a rectangular base. Every cube can represent  
either a radioactive source, material, or radiation detector. The base can  
contain 3 layers of 4 by 4 cubes maximum. Every cube can be programmed through  
I2C to change what it represents. Up to 256 types of isotopes and up to 256  
types of materials are supported, extending this is also possible. Radiation  
detectors can be programmed to detect any combination of alpha, beta, gamma  
and neutron radiation.
