-2. Make all functions const member where possible, especially in Voxel
-1. pointAlongVec() and moveToPointAlong() moved from helpers.cpp
  to particle.cpp -> make corresponding changes - DONE
0. Add moveToPointAlong() to Particle instead of helpers.cpp - DONE
1. Replace std::array<float, 3> with struct Vec3 - DONE
2. Adjust data types where float is excessive (if needed)
3. Explicitly include all used headers in every implementation file
instead of chaining #include in files - NO NEED?
4. Finish data.cpp
